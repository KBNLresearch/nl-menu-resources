<h1><a href="nl-menu/">NL-menu resurrected</a></h1>
<p>This is a reconstructed snapshot of <em>NL-menu</em>, which was the first Dutch web index. This snapshot was recovered from a CD-ROM with the contents of <em>NL-menu</em>, which was created shortly before the site closed down in early 2004. The ISO image with the unmodified source data can be downloaded <a href="">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Links to categories that contain sub-categories don't work in Firefox. A workaround is to right-click on the link and open it in a new tab (or disable JavaScript). In Chrome/Chromium these links work normally.</li>
<li>The site contains a number of forms that don't work because the associated CGI scripts are missing (these scripts are not on the CD-ROM).</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.kbresearch.nl/nl-menu/nl-menu/nlmenu.nl/fset/zoekenplus.html?http://www.kbresearch.nl/nl-menu/nl-menu/nlmenu.nl/admin/colofon.html"><em>Colofon</em></a> page shows the URL <em>http://www.kbresearch.nl</em>, instead of the original <em>http://www.nl-menu.nl</em>. This is an unintended side-effect of the <a href="https://github.com/KBNLresearch/nl-menu-resources/blob/master/scripts/fixhtml.sh">script</a> that was used to make the site work on the <em>kbresearch</em> domain.</li>
