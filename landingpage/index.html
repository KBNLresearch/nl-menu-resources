<p>This is a reconstructed snapshot of <em>NL-menu</em>, which was the first Dutch web index. This snapshot was recovered from a CD-ROM with the contents of <em>NL-menu</em>, which was created shortly before the site closed down in early 2004.</p>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Links to categories that contain sub-categories don't work in Firefox. Workaround: right-click on the link and open it in a new tab (or disable JavaScript). In Chrome/Chromium these links work normally.</li>
<li>The site contains a number of forms that don't work because the associated CGI scripts are missing (these scripts are not on the CD-ROM).</li>
<li>Some pages show the URL <em>http://www.kbresearch.nl</em>, instead of the original <em>http://www.nl-menu.nl</em>. This is an unintended side-effect of the script that was used to update the links.</li>
</ul>
